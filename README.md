# Web control panel for futures trading in Bybit
Hi, I'm dropping here one of my projects, I developed this control panel when I was trading in Bybit exchange to help control my positions at any time. Even if I don't have access to my phone or PC. The idea was that, markets move fast and at any time, we all know that, you can just ask somebody(even a stranger) to give you his phone and you will be able to fully see what's going on and act if you have to.
I've been using it for a long time, so it's tested and I haven't found any issues(can be trusted...), just make sure your API keys are on the right place, and you will have one more place from where you(or others if you want) can see and manage your active position.

Usage is simple, after you put your keys in the config.php file, you will be able to create a native auth user to allow you to execute the php scripts which actually does the thing.
